# Limited compatibility warranty (block format changes)

The author provides a limited warranty related to changes introduced
by the author for new/updated block formats.

If a released version contains a material parsing error for a supported
block format due to such changes, the author will make reasonable efforts
to provide a fix in a subsequent release.

This is not an SLA and does not cover forks, undocumented protocol changes,
external data corruption, or third-party modifications.
